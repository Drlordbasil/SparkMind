The package requirements for the given Python program are:

- requests (to make HTTP requests)
- beautifulsoup4 (to parse HTML content)
- transformers (to use the sentiment-analysis pipeline)

To create a requirements.txt file, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This will generate a requirements.txt file containing all the installed packages in your Python environment. You can then install these packages using the "-r" flag:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Please note that you may need to manually remove any unnecessary packages from the requirements.txt file before sharing it with others.
